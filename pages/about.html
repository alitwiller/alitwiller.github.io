              <h2>About Donut Delights</h2>
              <p>Melvin Furballski started Donut Delights in 1971. Melvin was a poor immigrant baker from Eastern Poland. In 1970, he fled the Communist regime that had been ruling his homeland for years, and settled in New York City. He then hopped on a bus headed for the west coast, but the bus broke down in Champaign, IL.  He decided to settle down there.  He opened up a donut stand, and in just six months, he had made enough money to open up a small shop.  He named the shop "Donut Delights" when it opened in 1971.</p>

              <h2>Fire</h2>
              <p>In 1986, a fire broke out in the kitchen during the night, ruining all the ovens. It spread to office and destroyed much of the shop's financial records, BUT NOT THE RECIPES. Melvin was able to rebuild after the incident, and his business quickly grew larger than before. Now, Donut Delights is known as the "Breakfast Heaven" of the Champaign area</p>
